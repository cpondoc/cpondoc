### Hey there! I'm Chris Pondoc!

I'm a senior/coterm at Stanford, where I study computer science. I'm broadly interested in human-AI interaction, machine learning and data systems, and crypto.

I'm currently at Oxford, where I'm studying reinforcement learning. I'm also collaborating on several independent research projects.
